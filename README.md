### Manual Installation (for humans)

**Quick Install:**

```bash
# Clone into your project's plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/laris-co/ralph-local.git plugins/ralph-local

# Or install globally for all Claude Code projects
git clone https://github.com/laris-co/ralph-local.git ~/.claude/plugins/ralph-local
```

**Enable the Plugin:**

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "ralph-local@nat-plugins": true
  }
}
```

Or if installed globally:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "ralph-local": true
  }
}
```

**Verify Installation:**

```bash
# Check if commands are available
/ralph-loop --help
/cancel-ralph
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start a Ralph loop
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API for todos. Requirements: CRUD operations, input validation, tests. Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when done." --completion-promise "COMPLETE" --max-iterations 50
```

Claude will:
- Implement the API iteratively
- Run tests and see failures
- Fix bugs based on test output
- Iterate until all requirements met
- Output the completion promise when done

---

## Why This Fork?

This is a local fork of the official `ralph-wiggum` plugin with the following improvements:

1. **Session Isolation** - Fixes cross-session interference ([PR #15853](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/pull/15853) contributed upstream)
2. **Parse Error Fixes** - Fixed `````!` pattern that broke eval in cancel command
3. **Worktree Isolation** - Uses absolute paths for multi-agent worktree support
4. **Oracle Forum Integration** - EXIT_LOOP signal support for multi-agent coordination
5. **Write Tool** - Uses Write tool instead of bash to preserve special characters

> 🎉 **Contributing Back**: The session isolation fix has been submitted as [PR #15853](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/pull/15853) to the official claude-code repository.

**Credit**: Original concept and implementation by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) and Anthropic's Claude Code team.

## What is Ralph?

Ralph is a development methodology based on continuous AI agent loops. As Geoffrey Huntley describes it: **"Ralph is a Bash loop"** - a simple `while true` that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt file, allowing it to iteratively improve its work until completion.

The technique is named after Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, embodying the philosophy of persistent iteration despite setbacks.

### Core Concept

This plugin implements Ralph using a **Stop hook** that intercepts Claude's exit attempts:

```bash
# You run ONCE:
/ralph-loop "Your task description" --completion-promise "DONE"

# Then Claude Code automatically:
# 1. Works on the task
# 2. Tries to exit
# 3. Stop hook blocks exit
# 4. Stop hook feeds the SAME prompt back
# 5. Repeat until completion
```

The loop happens **inside your current session** - you don't need external bash loops. The Stop hook in `hooks/stop-hook.sh` creates the self-referential feedback loop by blocking normal session exit.

This creates a **self-referential feedback loop** where:
- The prompt never changes between iterations
- Claude's previous work persists in files
- Each iteration sees modified files and git history
- Claude autonomously improves by reading its own past work in files

---

## Commands

### /ralph-loop

Start a Ralph loop in your current session.

**Usage:**
```bash
/ralph-loop "<prompt>" --max-iterations <n> --completion-promise "<text>"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)
- `--completion-promise <text>` - Phrase that signals completion

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic usage with safety limit
/ralph-loop "Build a todo CLI app with tests" --max-iterations 30

# With completion promise
/ralph-loop "Implement feature X. Output DONE when complete." --completion-promise "DONE" --max-iterations 20

# Long-running task
/ralph-loop "Refactor codebase to use TypeScript. Output COMPLETE when all files converted and tests pass." --completion-promise "COMPLETE" --max-iterations 100
```

### /cancel-ralph

Cancel the active Ralph loop.

**Usage:**
```bash
/cancel-ralph
```

This will:
1. Show current iteration count if loop is active
2. Remove `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` to stop the loop
3. Allow normal session exit

---

## Prompt Writing Best Practices

### 1. Clear Completion Criteria

❌ Bad: "Build a todo API and make it good."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Build a REST API for todos.

When complete:
- All CRUD endpoints working
- Input validation in place
- Tests passing (coverage > 80%)
- README with API docs
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 2. Incremental Goals

❌ Bad: "Create a complete e-commerce platform."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Phase 1: User authentication (JWT, tests)
Phase 2: Product catalog (list/search, tests)
Phase 3: Shopping cart (add/remove, tests)

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all phases done.
```

### 3. Self-Correction

❌ Bad: "Write code for feature X."

✅ Good:
```markdown
Implement feature X following TDD:
1. Write failing tests
2. Implement feature
3. Run tests
4. If any fail, debug and fix
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat until all green
7. Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

### 4. Escape Hatches

Always use `--max-iterations` as a safety net to prevent infinite loops on impossible tasks:

```bash
# Recommended: Always set a reasonable iteration limit
/ralph-loop "Try to implement feature X" --max-iterations 20

# In your prompt, include what to do if stuck:
# "After 15 iterations, if not complete:
#  - Document what's blocking progress
#  - List what was attempted
#  - Suggest alternative approaches"
```

**Note**: The `--completion-promise` uses exact string matching, so you cannot use it for multiple completion conditions (like "SUCCESS" vs "BLOCKED"). Always rely on `--max-iterations` as your primary safety mechanism.

---

## Philosophy

Ralph embodies several key principles:

### 1. Iteration > Perfection
Don't aim for perfect on first try. Let the loop refine the work.

### 2. Failures Are Data
"Deterministically bad" means failures are predictable and informative. Use them to tune prompts.

### 3. Operator Skill Matters
Success depends on writing good prompts, not just having a good model.

### 4. Persistence Wins
Keep trying until success. The loop handles retry logic automatically.

---

## When to Use Ralph

**Good for:**
- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration and refinement (e.g., getting tests to pass)
- Greenfield projects where you can walk away
- Tasks with automatic verification (tests, linters)
- Long-running development sessions (hours+)
- After planning sessions when context is established

**Not good for:**
- Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions
- One-shot operations
- Tasks with unclear success criteria
- Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead)
- Cold starts without shared context

---

## Real-World Results

- Successfully generated 6 repositories overnight in Y Combinator hackathon testing
- One $50k contract completed for $297 in API costs
- Created entire programming language ("cursed") over 3 months using this approach
- **PhD thesis documentation**: 90+ consecutive iterations (iterations 84-115) capturing research progress
- **Speckit workflow mastery**: 5 iterations building 3 complete apps with 2x speed improvement each time
- **Oracle v2 infrastructure**: 66 minutes, 28 tasks, 4,479 documents indexed in one session

---

## Integration with Other Tools

Ralph Loop works exceptionally well when combined with other development patterns:

### Ralph + Speckit + Subagents

```
Speckit    → Creates structure (spec → plan → tasks)
Subagents  → Handle bulk work in parallel
Ralph Loop → Ensures completion (iterate until done)
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Use `/speckit.specify` to create feature spec
2. Use `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
3. Use `/speckit.tasks` to break down into actionable tasks
4. Launch Ralph loop to execute: `/ralph-loop "Complete all tasks in tasks.md" --max-iterations 50`

### Multi-Agent Coordination (Advanced)

**Oracle Forum + Ralph Loop** enables multiple agents in simultaneous loops:

```bash
# Agent 1 starts Ralph loop
/ralph-loop "Build backend API. Check oracle_threads() for EXIT_LOOP signal." --max-iterations 50

# Agent 2 starts Ralph loop
/ralph-loop "Build frontend UI. Check oracle_threads() for EXIT_LOOP signal." --max-iterations 50

# Coordinator sends EXIT_LOOP via Oracle Forum Thread when both complete
```

**Why Forum > Search:**
- Status visible across all agents
- Full context history preserved
- Async communication without polling
- Natural completion detection

## Advanced Usage

### GoGoGo Mode

For sessions where context is already established:

```bash
/gogogo-ralph "MQTT backend working"
```

**Philosophy**: "We talked enough. Now build."

**Pattern:**
1. Plan in regular session (establish shared context)
2. Switch to GoGoGo mode (remove decision overhead)
3. Ralph executes until completion promise
4. Auto-handoff at 90% context
5. Auto-learning at 70%, blog draft at 85%

**When to use:**
- ✅ After planning session (context exists)
- ✅ After spec discussion (shared understanding)
- ✅ Greenfield projects (can walk away)
- ❌ Cold start (no context)
- ❌ Unclear requirements

### Multi-Agent Pattern

**Setup:**
1. Each agent has own worktree (via MAW - Multi-Agent Worktree)
2. Each agent runs independent Ralph loop
3. Coordination via Oracle Forum threads
4. EXIT_LOOP signal for completion

**Example:**

```bash
# Agent 1: Backend
cd agents/1
/ralph-loop "Build API backend. Check Thread #10 for EXIT_LOOP." --max-iterations 50

# Agent 2: Frontend
cd agents/2
/ralph-loop "Build React UI. Check Thread #10 for EXIT_LOOP." --max-iterations 50

# Coordinator: Monitor progress, send EXIT_LOOP when both complete
```

## Troubleshooting

### Loop Won't Stop

**Symptom**: Claude keeps iterating even after task completion

**Solutions:**
1. Use `/cancel-ralph` command
2. Manually remove: `rm .claude/ralph-loop.local.md`
3. Add `--max-iterations` safety limit
4. Use clear `--completion-promise` with exact match

### Parse Errors in Cancel Command

**Symptom**: `eval: ... syntax error near unexpected token`

**Solution**: This fork fixes the `````!` pattern error. Ensure you're using `ralph-local`, not the official `ralph-wiggum`.

### Hook Not Firing

**Symptom**: Loop exits normally instead of continuing

**Check:**
1. Plugin enabled in `.claude/settings.json`
2. Stop hook installed: `ls -la hooks/stop-hook.sh`
3. Hook permissions: `chmod +x hooks/stop-hook.sh`
4. Claude Code version supports stop hooks

### Worktree Isolation Issues

**Symptom**: Multi-agent loops interfering with each other

**Solution**: This fork uses absolute paths. Update to latest version:
```bash
cd plugins/ralph-local
git pull origin main
```
